\label{Barrier}
The barrier options are popular and attractive thanks to benefits that they give investors more flexibility to express their view on the asset price movement in the option contract. The buyer can achieve {\itshape option premium reduction} through the barrier provision by not paying a premium to cover scenarios he or she views as unlikely. The option writer can limit liabilities when the asset price rises acutely.
