\section{Condition of the Black-Sholes-Merton model}
Six assumptions of the Black-Sholes-Merton model is given by
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The option is European 
	\item No dividends are paid out during the option's life
	\item Efficient markets
	\item There are no transaction costs in buying the option
	\item The risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying are known and constant
	\item The returns on the underlying are normally distributed
\end{enumerate}
\indent{\itshape\bfseries Problem}\\[0.5cm]
Consider a European call option on FPT stock without dividends. Market movements cannot be predicted. When the stock price is \$2.5, the exercise price is \$3, the risk-free interest rate is 5\%, the volatility is 23.7\% per annum,
and the time to maturity is 6 months. These information is given 5 first assumptions. We need to check the last one which is the rate of returns are normally distributed.\\
\indent{\itshape\bfseries Testing for normal distribution}\\[0.5cm]
The software is using for testing data is R â€“ Studio. The code is shown at the end of report. We will use graphical methods which is normal probability plot (Q-Q plot or quantile quantile plots). \\
Q-Q plot is a graphical technique to help us assess whether or not a data set is approximately normally distributed. The question is how to make a Q-Q plot. The method is following  
\begin{itemize}
\item Sort the numbers from smallest to largest
\item Draw a normal distribution curve
\item Find the Z-value for each segment
\item Plot data set value against the Z-value 
\end{itemize}
If the most part the data points follow along the straight line, this will be normally distributed. Here is our result

	\caption{The distribution of FPT's returns}
\end{figure}

This graph satisfies conditions of normal distribution. Here the x-axis is the probability and the y-axis is the values of returns.
Therefore, the returns is most likely normally distribution.
